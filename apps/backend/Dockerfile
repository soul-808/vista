# Multi-stage build notes:
# Ensuring you don't need Maven installed in production
# Caches the dependencies, so minor code changes rebuild faster
# Pulls in just the JRE (Java Runtime) â€” no compiler, no Maven
# Shrinks your image size dramatically
# Reduces the attack surface for security
# Ideal for OpenShift or CI/CD environments
